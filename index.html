            <h3>BANGLADESH TRAVEL: 30 THINGS TO KNOW BEFORE YOU GO..</h3>
            <p class="aline-text">Travel to Bangladesh is one of the last opportunities in South East Asia to experience
                travel with a true
                sense of adventure: Heading off the beaten track and into a country that does not have an established
                tourism infrastructure, especially not for foreign tourists. Bangladesh travel is still, in many ways, a
                journey into the lesser known.</p>

            <p class="aline-text">Bangladesh is without doubt one of Asia’s undiscovered gems, but unfortunately (mostly
                due to a mixture
                of political instability and natural disasters), Bangladesh has gathered not the best reputation
                internationally. Bangladesh has yet to experience much tourism and is mostly un-touristed: a foreign
                face will excite a lot of attention and interest, almost always of a friendly and kindly nature. “Excuse
                me mam, your country?” were probably the words I heard spoken most to me on my trip.</p>
